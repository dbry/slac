Update: Since I developed and named this codec I have been made aware of a
        proprietary audio compression algorithm from Texas Instruments for
        its CC85xx line of chips (and perhaps others) also called SLAC
        (Slightly Lossy Audio Codec). There is no relation between the two
        codecs (mine is completely original and neither lossy nor
        proprietary). I apologize for any confusion.

A very simple lossless audio compressor. Designed to achieve about the same
compression as flac -0 or shorten with the absolute minimum amount of
complexity (in fact, the entire library for both encoding and decoding is a
single C file of less than 500 lines). Being so simple, it's also pretty
quick, even in pure C without multithreading. Possible uses:

1. Learning how lossless audio compressors work, or the starting point for
   your own lossless codec experiments.
2. Easily incorporating lossless audio compression into other apps, perhaps
   even including translation into another language.
3. Implementing lossless audio compression on limited resource systems, or
   even hardware.

It's important to note that this is NOT a new lossless audio compression
file format! There is a simple command-line front end for demo purposes
that works with WAV files, but the resulting SLAC files are simply a
concatenation of the generated blocks and provide no metadata storage,
no error detection, and no seeking capability. The format COULD be used
inside of another container format like Matroska, but I'm not sure that
would have any value.

To build the demo app:

    $ gcc -O2 *.c -o slac

The "help" display from the demo app:

 Usage:     SLAC [-options] infile.wav outfile.slac
            SLAC -d [-options] infile.slac outfile.wav

 Pipes:     specify '-' for filename, but not WAV output

 Options:  -d     = decode operation (default = encode))
           -bn    = override block samples (default = 1024)
           -h     = display this help message
           -j0    = encode stereo files as L/R
           -j1    = encode stereo files as M/S (default)
           -j2    = encode stereo files using best (slow)
           -q     = quiet mode (display errors only)
           -r     = raw output (no WAV header written)
           -v     = verbose (display lots of info)
           -y     = overwrite outfile if it exists


The compression algorithm uses only standard techniques:

1. The audio data samples are divided into blocks. By default these are 1024
   samples but can be essentially any size (there are trade-offs) and this
   step is actually done by the client of the library.

2. For stereo data, a check is made for identical channels (dual-mono),
   otherwise the data is optionally converted to mid-side (which on average
   compresses better), or simply left as left-right.

3. The data is scanned for redundant LSB zeros, and if these are found in
   all samples a right-shift is performed to reduce the sample magnitude. The
   size of the shift is stored in the output bitstream so that the samples can
   be left-shifted at decode.

4. The decorrelation method is simply pure deltas (i.e. each sample is
   replaced with the difference between it and the previous sample). This is
   repeated in passes and the resulting magnitude checked until the optimum
   number of passes is determined. This value (from -1 to 6) is stored with
   the audio and used on decode to re-correlate the audio samples. Note that
   the -1 value is for cases where the samples are negatively correlated
   (rare in music but possible in test cases).

5. The signed samples are converted to a nonnegative integer representation
   (with the sign in the LSB) and these are encoded with standard Rice codes.
   The optimum Golomb-Rice parameter k is determined by trial from just the
   sum of the values to be encoded. The first few un-decorrelated samples are
   encoded with their own Rice parameter because they often have wildly
   different magnitudes than the majority of the samples. Also, a check is
   made for all the samples being zero, in which case nothing is encoded.

6. There are several experimental versions or variations of SLAC that may be
   of interest. These are in separate branches and not official or guaranteed
   to be correct, but they may be informative or useful:

   branch name              description
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   experimental-speedup         uses new functions in bitstream.h to read and
                                write unary counts, plus some other changes
                                resulting in significant speedup (bit-compatible
                                with existing code)

   experimental-k-zones         provides for a sequence of Rice 'k' values for
                                each frame for improved compression with little
                                decoding speed penalty (not compatible with
                                existing code)

   experimental-stereo-modes    adds left+side, right+side, left+sum and
                                right+sum to supported stereo modes providing
                                some compression improvement (not compatible
                                with existing code)

   experimental-half-rice-codes uses codes midway between the standard Rice
                                power-of-two 'k' values to improve compression,
                                especially with smaller values (like 8-bit)

   experimental-decorrelation   uses a new decorrelation function (along with
                                the previous, simpler "difference" version) to
                                improve the compression ratio about 0.5%
